# TSPQuest

This repository contains Python scripts for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using different algorithms.

## Description

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in computer science. The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin city. This repository provides implementations of various algorithms to solve the TSP, ranging from exact methods to heuristic and approximation algorithms.

## Algorithms

The scripts in this repository implement the following algorithms for solving the TSP:

1. **Brute Force**: An exact algorithm that generates all possible tours and then selects the shortest one. The time complexity is \(O(n!)\), which makes it impractical for large instances.

2. **Branch and Bound**: An exact algorithm that uses a tree search strategy, creating branches for all possible paths and bounding (discarding) paths that cannot result in a better solution than the best one found so far.

3. **Held-Karp Algorithm**: An exact algorithm that uses dynamic programming to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and reuses solutions to these subproblems to build up the solution to the full problem.

4. **Nearest Neighbor (NN)**: A heuristic algorithm where the salesman chooses the closest unvisited city as the next destination. It quickly produces a reasonably short route but may not always produce the optimal solution.

5. **2-Opt Algorithm**: A heuristic algorithm that starts with an initial solution (often generated by the NN algorithm) and iteratively improves it by swapping two cities if the resulting tour is shorter.

6. **Simulated Annealing**: A probabilistic technique that is used for finding an approximate solution to an optimization problem. It begins with a random tour and then randomly swaps two cities to create a new tour. If the new tour is shorter, it is always accepted. However, if the new tour is longer, it is accepted with a certain probability, which decreases as the algorithm progresses.

## Dataset

The script uses the following TSP datasets, which were retrieved from [The University of Waterloo's TSP page](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/countries.html):

- `lu98.tsp`: Represents the locations of 980 cities in Luxembourg.
- `qa194.tsp`: Represents 194 locations in Qatar.
- `wi29.tsp`: Represents the locations of 29 cities in Western Sahara.

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

python benchmark.py Datasets/`dataset` `algorithm`

Replace `dataset` with the name of the TSP dataset file (e.g., `lu98.tsp`), and `algorithm` with the algorithm you want to use (`brute_force`, `branch_and_bound`, `held_karp`, `nearest_neighbor`, `two_opt`, or `simulated_annealing`).

For example, to solve the `lu98.tsp` dataset using the brute-force algorithm, run:

python benchmark.py Datasets/lu98.tsp brute_force


## Dependencies

The scripts require Python and the following Python libraries:

- `argparse`
- `math`
- `itertools`

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank our professors and peers for their valuable feedback and support throughout this project. We would also like to acknowledge the creators of the datasets we used for our analysis.

## Future Work

Future work could involve testing these algorithms on larger datasets beyond 1000 cities to assess scalability. Exploring metaheuristic algorithms like Genetic Algorithms or Ant Colony Optimization could also be beneficial. Machine learning techniques, particularly reinforcement learning, could offer a novel approach to solving the TSP. Additionally, it would be interesting to investigate the impact of problem constraints such as time-windows or vehicle capacities on the performance of these algorithms.
